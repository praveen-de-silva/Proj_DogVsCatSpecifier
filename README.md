# 🐾 AI Pet Classifier - Dog vs Cat Specifier

An intelligent image classification application that uses deep learning to identify whether an uploaded image contains a dog or a cat. Built with TensorFlow/Keras and deployed using Streamlit.

---

## 🧠 Theoretical Background

This application solves a **binary image classification** problem, determining whether an uploaded image contains a **dog** or a **cat**. The model is built using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**, which learns visual patterns such as edges, shapes, fur textures, and facial features.

During training, the CNN sees many images from both classes. For each image:

1. Predicts a label  
2. Compares with the correct label  
3. Adjusts weights via **backpropagation** and **gradient descent**  

Over thousands of images, the model learns the visual differences between dogs and cats.

### Model Architecture
- **Convolution Layers**: extract edges and small patterns  
- **Pooling Layers**: reduce spatial size while keeping important info  
- **Flatten Layer**: converts features to a vector  
- **Dense Layers**: final decision-making  
- **Output Layer**: produces probability (0-1)  

**Interpretation:**  
```
Closer to 1 → Dog  
Closer to 0 → Cat
```

## 🔮 How Prediction Works

1. User uploads an image  
2. Image is resized to **128×128**  
3. Pixel values normalized to **0-1**  
4. Image passed through **CNN model**  
5. Model outputs a **probability score**  
6. App classifies:  
```
> 0.5 → Dog  
< 0.5 → Cat
```

### Example
```
Prediction = 0.87 → 87% confidence → Dog  
Prediction = 0.12 → 12% confidence → Cat
```

This allows **real-time image classification**.
